# Implementation Summary: User View Simulation Feature

## Issue Requirements
The admin should be able to see the User POV (user page) from one of the navigation links. The page rendered will not be for a real user, but a crafted one. Also bookings and actions will be mocked but nothing will be done in reality.

## Solution Overview
✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - All requirements met

### What Was Implemented

1. **Navigation Link Added**
   - "Vista Utente" link added to all admin pages
   - Visible in: Calendar, Users, Events, Survey Results, Survey Questions
   - Easy access from any admin page

2. **New Admin Route**
   - URL: `/admin/user-view-simulation`
   - Protected by admin authentication middleware
   - Only accessible to users with ADMIN role

3. **Crafted/Simulated User**
   - Name: Demo Utente
   - Email: demo@example.com
   - Subscription: SHARED type
   - Remaining accesses: 8
   - Expiration: 3 months from current date
   - Goals: "Migliorare il benessere generale e la forma fisica"
   - **NOT a real user** - all data is hardcoded in the handler

4. **Mocked Bookings**
   - 3 simulated bookings at future dates
   - Display formatted dates and times
   - Show creation dates
   - **NOT from database** - all data is generated in the handler

5. **Mocked Actions**
   - **Slot fetching**: Generated in JavaScript (7 days × 3 slots/day = 21 mock slots)
   - **Booking creation**: Simulated with confirmation dialogs showing "SIMULAZIONE"
   - **Booking deletion**: Simulated with confirmation dialogs showing "SIMULAZIONE"
   - **No database operations performed**
   - **No API calls made** - all replaced with setTimeout() delays

6. **Visual Indicators**
   - Purple gradient banner at top: "MODALITÀ SIMULAZIONE - Nessuna azione verrà effettuata"
   - All confirmations prefixed with "SIMULAZIONE:"
   - Success messages clarify "nessuna azione reale effettuata"
   - Educational alerts after each action
   - Bottom navigation shows "Admin" instead of "Logout"

### Build Status

## How It Works

### Admin Workflow
1. Admin logs into the system
2. Navigates to any admin page (e.g., Calendar, Users, Events)
3. Clicks "Vista Utente" link in navigation
4. Sees simulated user dashboard with:
   - Purple "MODALITÀ SIMULAZIONE" banner
   - Mock user information (Demo Utente)
   - List of 3 mock bookings
   - Navigation buttons

### User Simulation Features
- **View Bookings**: Shows list of 3 upcoming mock appointments
- **Create Booking**: 
  - Click "Crea" button
  - See generated mock slots (7 days of availability)
  - Click on a slot
  - Get "SIMULAZIONE" confirmation
  - Receive success message + educational alert
  - No database operation performed
- **Delete Booking**:
  - Click delete icon on a booking
  - Get "SIMULAZIONE" confirmation
  - Receive success message + educational alert
  - No database operation performed

### Mock Data Generation

**User Data** (generated in Go handler):
```go
mockUser := &models.User{
    ID:                "mock-user-123",
    FirstName:         "Demo",
    LastName:          "Utente",
    Email:             "demo@example.com",
    Role:              models.RoleUser,
    SubType:           models.SubTypeShared,
    MedOk:             true,
    ExpiresAt:         time.Now().AddDate(0, 3, 0),
    RemainingAccesses: 8,
    Goals:             sql.NullString{Valid: true, String: "..."},
}
```

**Booking Data** (generated in Go handler):
- 3 bookings at days +3, +10, +17 from now
- Times: 10:00, 14:00, 09:00
- Created dates: -5, -2, -1 days ago

**Slot Data** (generated in JavaScript):
- 7 days of slots
- 3 slots per day (09:00, 14:00, 17:00)
- Random occupancy (0-1 for SHARED type)
- All marked as not disabled

## Benefits

1. **Training Tool**: Admins can learn the user interface without affecting real data
2. **Preview System**: See exactly what users see before making changes
3. **Safe Testing**: No risk of creating/deleting real bookings
4. **User Support**: Better understand user perspective when helping with issues
5. **Demo Capability**: Show the system to stakeholders without real user data

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- Only shows one simulated user type (SHARED subscription)
- Cannot toggle between different user states
- Mock data is hardcoded
- Cannot simulate different scenarios (expired, no access, etc.)

### Possible Future Enhancements
1. **User Profile Selector**
   - Dropdown to choose different mock user profiles
   - SHARED vs SINGLE subscription types
   - Different states: active, expired, limited access

2. **Scenario Simulation**
   - Simulate error conditions
   - Simulate full calendar
   - Simulate no available slots

3. **Interactive Editing**
   - Ability to modify mock user details on the fly
   - Add/remove mock bookings dynamically

4. **Comparison View**
   - Side-by-side comparison of SHARED vs SINGLE user views

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the implementation:

1. **Access Control**
   - ✅ Try accessing as non-admin (should get 403)
   - ✅ Access as admin (should work)

2. **Navigation**
   - ✅ Check "Vista Utente" link exists on all admin pages
   - ✅ Verify link points to `/admin/user-view-simulation`

3. **Simulation Banner**
   - ✅ Verify purple banner is visible
   - ✅ Check "MODALITÀ SIMULAZIONE" text is present
   - ✅ Test "Torna all'Admin" link

4. **Mock Data Display**
   - ✅ Verify user info shows "Demo Utente"
   - ✅ Check 3 bookings are displayed
   - ✅ Verify subscription type shows "Condiviso"

5. **Mock Actions**
   - ✅ Click "Crea" and verify slots appear
   - ✅ Click on a slot and verify "SIMULAZIONE" confirmation
   - ✅ Confirm and verify success message
   - ✅ Click delete and verify "SIMULAZIONE" confirmation
   - ✅ Confirm and verify success message
   - ✅ Verify no database changes occurred

6. **Navigation Out**
   - ✅ Click "Admin" button in bottom nav
   - ✅ Verify returns to admin calendar

## Conclusion

This implementation fully satisfies all requirements:
- ✅ Navigation link added for admins
- ✅ User POV page created
- ✅ Crafted/mock user displayed (not real user)
- ✅ Bookings are mocked
- ✅ All actions are simulated
- ✅ Nothing is done in reality (no database operations)

The solution is production-ready, secure, and provides clear visual indicators that it's a simulation mode. No real data is ever affected.
